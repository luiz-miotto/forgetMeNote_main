SEPT 01 23:
Next objects to tackle:
* Apply method level security
* Pull user records from database to allow for events to be user specific
    * maybe plan where the user fits into the mechanics of the app, i.e. what sort of
    functionality will user-event relationship allow for

SEPT 02 23:
* Regarding users: Users will be able to create events and add other app users to the event.
    Events will have an `eventCreator` and `listOfInvitedUsers` attributes
CLOSING:
    successfully denormalized user/event relationship by creating a events_with_users table
    Table works but always defaults to event_id = 0 and user_id = 0
    Need to figure out if foreign key is necessary or a hindrance
    Need to also understand if data denormalization needs to happen in database, i.e. with foreign keys, or
    if the denormalization happening via the code is enough/exactly hwat I need
    One potential solution would be to save the event, get the id generated for the event, and then manually add the
    event_id to the events_with_users before saving it to the repository


SEPT 03 23:
* Worked out data denormilization
*Need to figure out why attendee list is blank when submitting form despite the fact that the attendee list
    is sucessfully pulled from db and is populated on web

SEPT 09 23:
* finally worked out issue with not passing user data in post.
*App now successfully saves events and events_with_users with all necessary user data to database
NEXT ITEMS TO WORK ON
*Want to allow use to group events, i.e. allow them to create folders for event grouping
* Working on creating an event details page. Need to work out how to get event instance from db
    *also need to understand why jpa requires Optional<Object> and how to use it to access the object

SEPT 20 23:
* have configured user details, added ability to deactivage events and reactivate events
* need to figure out why pressing the activate/deactivate button does not properly redirect the user since the
href/url that is generated on the button seems to match the id
    I'm assuming something wrong is happening in the post request and the correct url is not being sent

OCT 28 23:
* Need to implement an ajax call in the eventDetailController to do allwo for the active state of event to be updated
upon clicking on the active/deactivate button'

NOV 25 23
* A potential slight pivot for this app would be to make the notes/reminders that people leave public, partially public,
or at the very least use it to gather data that on what people need notes/scheduling reminders for.

If notes/reminders are made public, the potential would be that other usesrs can leave useful comments regarding those tasks.
This could potentially help solve the problem of "you don't know what you don't know" since users would be given helpful
instructions without asking for them or even knowing they should ask for it.

If notes/events/reminders are made public or data is shared, that data can be used for targeted marketing or the data can
be used intelligently in other ways, such as gathering info on what people need help reminding of.for

December 17 23:
* Questions regarding RabbitMQ implementation:
If there is a consumer and a publisher, would the publisher, in the case of this app, be the eventCreator and the GET's for list and individual event details?
    * If so, then in the case of the eventCreator, when exactly would the message be sent to Rabbitmq? When the user submits the new event? Would even

December 18 23:
* look at this article in regards to connectionfactory (it looks like a connection factory is required but I don't have one) https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-rabbitmq/

December 23 23:
* need to create database for emails sent out as well as denormalized database linking users to emails and sms messages sent out
    * columns for userNotificationHistory: userId, username, emailAddress, phoneNumber, messageId, messageTime, notificationType
    * For userNotificationDetails (this is an additional model/database) we will also track notificaiton preferences as well as "opt out" status of the user
    * Message should have

January 27 24:
* I'm a certain crossroads. I have been trying to implement angualr as the front end of my app. The benefits are that this allows for the html to redendered client side instead of server side, which then means I can make the app Restful
which then means I can use async methods in the app. However, angular has been proving to be particularly painful to implement. Currently I need to redirect the sign in URL but I am finding some resistance on this.

January 28 24:
* I was successfully able to get POST requests, i.e. creating a new event, to work with Angular front end. However, I did have to severly strip down Sprng security config: had to remove loginForm(***this might not have been needed!), allow "/events"
through csrf and had to disable cors
* I think going forward I will continue working on this app with a stripped down security, but eventually I will return to implementing security to it.
* really useful info here for when I return https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/94nrjk/http_failure_response_for_httplocalhost4200login/
* additionally, need to make sure that the next versions used in whatever tutorial I find for Angular v Spring security have some parity with the versions used in this software

January 28 24 Note 2:
* I'm not happy with the fact that I had to strip spring security as for all purposes, security is gone, since no login occurs.

January 28 24 Note 3:
*Final note for the day: all in all, having the stripped down version of security in order to allow for Angular is not that bad. Old server-side redended client still works, i.e. localhost:8080, so security can still be demonstrated via that client instead


January 30 24:
* was able to add scheduledDate date picker for the eventCreator form. Now I need to add the datepicker for dueDate maybe(?) see this article for potential issue https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74775898/matdatepicker-can-only-be-associated-with-a-single-input
* Additionally, I need to correct the formatting that the date is currently being saved with
