SEPT 01 23:
Next objects to tackle:
* Apply method level security
* Pull user records from database to allow for events to be user specific
    * maybe plan where the user fits into the mechanics of the app, i.e. what sort of
    functionality will user-event relationship allow for

SEPT 02 23:
* Regarding users: Users will be able to create events and add other app users to the event.
    Events will have an `eventCreator` and `listOfInvitedUsers` attributes
CLOSING:
    successfully denormalized user/event relationship by creating a events_with_users table
    Table works but always defaults to event_id = 0 and user_id = 0
    Need to figure out if foreign key is necessary or a hindrance
    Need to also understand if data denormalization needs to happen in database, i.e. with foreign keys, or
    if the denormalization happening via the code is enough/exactly hwat I need
    One potential solution would be to save the event, get the id generated for the event, and then manually add the
    event_id to the events_with_users before saving it to the repository


SEPT 03 23:
* Worked out data denormilization
*Need to figure out why attendee list is blank when submitting form despite the fact that the attendee list
    is sucessfully pulled from db and is populated on web

SEPT 09 23:
* finally worked out issue with not passing user data in post.
*App now successfully saves events and events_with_users with all necessary user data to database
NEXT ITEMS TO WORK ON
*Want to allow use to group events, i.e. allow them to create folders for event grouping
* Working on creating an event details page. Need to work out how to get event instance from db
    *also need to understand why jpa requires Optional<Object> and how to use it to access the object

SEPT 20 23:
* have configured user details, added ability to deactivage events and reactivate events
* need to figure out why pressing the activate/deactivate button does not properly redirect the user since the
href/url that is generated on the button seems to match the id
    I'm assuming something wrong is happening in the post request and the correct url is not being sent

OCT 28 23:
* Need to implement an ajax call in the eventDetailController to do allwo for the active state of event to be updated
upon clicking on the active/deactivate button'

NOV 25 23
* A potential slight pivot for this app would be to make the notes/reminders that people leave public, partially public,
or at the very least use it to gather data that on what people need notes/scheduling reminders for.

If notes/reminders are made public, the potential would be that other usesrs can leave useful comments regarding those tasks.
This could potentially help solve the problem of "you don't know what you don't know" since users would be given helpful
instructions without asking for them or even knowing they should ask for it.

If notes/events/reminders are made public or data is shared, that data can be used for targeted marketing or the data can
be used intelligently in other ways, such as gathering info on what people need help reminding of.for
