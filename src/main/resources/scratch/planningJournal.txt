SEPT 01 23:
Next objects to tackle:
* Apply method level security
* Pull user records from database to allow for events to be user specific
    * maybe plan where the user fits into the mechanics of the app, i.e. what sort of
    functionality will user-event relationship allow for

SEPT 02 23:
* Regarding users: Users will be able to create events and add other app users to the event.
    Events will have an `eventCreator` and `listOfInvitedUsers` attributes
CLOSING:
    successfully denormalized user/event relationship by creating a events_with_users table
    Table works but always defaults to event_id = 0 and user_id = 0
    Need to figure out if foreign key is necessary or a hindrance
    Need to also understand if data denormalization needs to happen in database, i.e. with foreign keys, or
    if the denormalization happening via the code is enough/exactly hwat I need
    One potential solution would be to save the event, get the id generated for the event, and then manually add the
    event_id to the events_with_users before saving it to the repository


SEPT 03 23:
* Worked out data denormilization
*Need to figure out why attendee list is blank when submitting form despite the fact that the attendee list
    is sucessfully pulled from db and is populated on web
